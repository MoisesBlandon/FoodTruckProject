# FoodTruckProject
#Description
 This program allows users to add up to 5 food trucks. Any time a food truck is added by the user, they are prompted to give the name, type of food served, and rating of the food truck. Once the user is done listing their food trucks, they have the option to display all listed food trucks, see the average rating for all the trucks, see the highest rated truck, or simply just quit the application.
 
#Tech Used
The Food Truck App is made of a main method and various private methods that support the functionality of the application. The "run" method kicks everything off by containing a do-while loop that displays the main menu and allows the user to cycle through the options with a switch statement. The cases within the switch statement call their respective methods. 

In the Food Truck Class, there are private fields for the name of the food truck, type of food served, and the rating. It also consist of a constructor for the fields, setters and getters to get access to the private fields, and a toString method to display the information inside of the Food Truck App. 

#Lessons Learned
The main eye opener for me was seeing how topics learned from week one and even the pre-work could play their own intricate role to make a program work. I got to see how simple concepts such a Switch Statement or simply calling a method really help make the code more organize and easy to read. Option+Command S really came in handy while setting up the Food Truck Class. I used it to generate setters and getters, the constructor, and the toString method. Seeing how Eclipse formatted everything helped me retain the proper way of building a class.
